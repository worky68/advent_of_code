# Advent of Code

This repo houses code created to solve the various puzzles in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I typically use Advent of Code to test out new languages I am interested in, so be warned these solutions are not always the most elegant.

### Languages used thus far

* [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig)
* [Nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim)
* [C3](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c)
